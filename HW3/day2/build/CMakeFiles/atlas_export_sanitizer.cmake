# This script is used to tweak the exported file created by CMake for
# describing the installed targets of a release, not to treat it as a
# fatal error if one of the targets is missing. Which can very much
# be the case in a nightly, if a package fails building. But it should
# not stop the downstream projects from building all together.

   # at the build configuration time.
