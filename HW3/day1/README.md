## Day 1 Slide of the Homework 

Note that for the ~3 questions on the slide, I have various files uploaded here. The first question was answered after the other few, in the file:

**Question1_Output.txt** 

Here I left a comment as to how the compression and timing changed, but I show both the plots for Question 2 in the various .png files included in:

**Question2_plots** 

Next, in the directory **Question3_VaryingBaskets** I have .txt files of compression output from branches filled with:

1) integer filled branches
2) float filled branches and
3) 1/2 compressible, 1/2 incompressible

The corresponding plots showing the compression rate fall-off for the variables in these are in the directory 

**Question3_CompressionPlots**
